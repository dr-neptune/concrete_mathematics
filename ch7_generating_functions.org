#+TITLE: Chapter 7: Generating Functions

* Domino Theory and Change

Fun! A sequence of nontrivial problems solved with generating functions and some nice looking TeX

* Basic Maneuvers

Our generic generating function has the form

$G(z) = g_0 + g_1z + g_2z^2 + ... = \Sigma_{n \geq 0} g_n z^n$

** Additioin of Generating Functions

$\alpha F(z) + \beta G(z) = \Sigma_n (\alpha f_n + \beta g_n)z^n$

** Shifting

To shift by m places to the *right*, simply muliply by z^m
This way we form a generating function for the sequence $<0, 0, ..., 0, g_0, g_1, ...>$

$z^m G(z) = \Sigma_n g_{n - m}z^n$

To shift by m places to the *left* we subtract off the first m terms and then divide by z^m

$\frac{1}{z^m} G(z) - (g_0 + g_1 z + ... + g_{m - 1}z^{m - 1}) = \Sigma_{n \geq 0} g_{n + m}z^n$

** Constant Multiple

$G(cz) = \Sigma_n g_n(cz)^n = \Sigma_n c^n g_n z^n$

** Differentiation to bring down a factor (7.17)

$G'(z) = \Sigma_n (n + 1) g_{n + 1}z^n$

which we can shift to the right

$z G'(z) = \Sigma_n n g_n z^n$

** Integration lets us divide by n (7.19)

$\int_0^z G(t) dt = \Sigma_{n \geq 1} \frac{1}{n} g_{n - 1} z^n$

** Multiplication / Convolution (7.20)

$F(z)G(z) = \Sigma_n ( \Sigma_k f_k g_{n - k})z^n$

* Solving Recurrences

1. Write down a single equation that expresses $g_n$ in terms of other elements of the sequence. This equation should be valid for all integers n, assuming that $g_{-1} = g_{-2} = ... = 0$
2. Multiply both sides of the equation by $z^n$ and sum over all n. This gives, on the left, the sum $\Sigma_n g_n z^n$, which is the generating function $G(z)$. The right-hand side should be manipulated so that it becomes some other expression involving $G(z)$
3. Solve the resulting equation, getting a closed for for $G(z)$
4. Expand $G(z)$ into a power series and read off the coefficient of $z^n$; this is a closed form for $g_n$

** Rational Expansion Theorem for Distinct Roots

 If $R(z) = P(z)/Q(z)$, where $Q(z) = q_0(1 - \rho_1 z)...(1 - \rho_lz)$ and the numbers $(\rho_1, ..., \rho_l)$ are distinct, and if $P(z)$ is a polynomial of degree less than $l$, then

 $[z^n]R(z) = a_1\rho_1^n + ... + a_l\rho_l^n$ where $a_k = \frac{- \rho_k P(1 / \rho_k)}{Q'(1/\rho_k)}$

* Convolutions

The *convolution* of two given sequences $<f_0, f_1, ...> = <f_n>$ and $<g_0, g_1, ...> = <g_n>$ is the sequence $<f_0g_0 + f_0g_1 + f_1 g_0 + ...> = <\Sigma_k f_k g_{n - k}>$
Convolution of sequences corresponds to multiplication of their generating functions.
