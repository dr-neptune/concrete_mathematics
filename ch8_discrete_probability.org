#+TITLE: Chapter 8: Discrete Probability

* Definitions

** Probability Space

Probability space is a set $\Omega$ of all things that can happen in a given problem together with a rule that assigns a probability $P(\omega)$ to each elementary event $\omega \in \Omega$. The probability must be a non-negative number and the condition:

$\Sigma_{\omega \in \Omega} P(w) = 1$

must hold in every discrete probability space.

** Probability of an Event

The probability of an event A is defined by the formula

$P(\omega \in A) = \Sigma_{\omega \in A} P(\omega)$

** Independence of Random Variables

We say that X and Y are independant random variables if

$P(X = x$ and $Y = y) = P(X = x)\cdot P(Y = y)$

for all x and y.

** Expected Value

$\mathbb{E}(X) = \Sigma_{\omega \in \Omega} X(\omega) P(\omega)$

$\mathbb{E}(X + Y) = \mathbb{E}X + \mathbb{E}Y$

$\mathbb{E}(\alpha X) = \alpha \mathbb{E}X$

$\mathbb{E}(XY) = \mathbb{E}(X)\mathbb{E}(Y)$ if X and Y are independent

* Mean and Variance

** Variance

$\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{E}([X - \mathbb{E}X]^2) = \mathbb{E}(X^2) - (\mathbb{E}X)^2$

** Chebyshev's Inequality

$P((X - \mathbb{E}X)^2 \geq \alpha) \leq \mathbb{V}X/\alpha$ for all $\alpha > 0$

* Probability Generating Functions

** mth moment of X

$\mu_m = \Sigma_{k \geq 0} k^m P(X = k) = \mathbb{E}(X^m)$

* Flipping Coins

** Binomial Distribution

Let $p + q = 1$. Then we can write the probability generating function for the number of heads after one toss of the coin as

$H(z) = q + pz$.

If we toss the coin n times, always assuming that different coin tosses are independent, the number of heads is generated by

$H(z)^n = (q + pz)^n = \Sigma_{k \geq 0} {n \choose k} p^k q^{n - k} z^k$

according to the binomial theorem. Thus the chance that we obtain exactly k heads in n tosses is ${n \choose k}p^kq^{n-k}$.

This sequence of probabilities is called the *binomial distribution*.

** Generating Function for the Negative Binomial Distribution

$(\frac{p}{1 - qz})^n = \Sigma_k {n + k - 1 \choose k}p^n q^k z^k$
