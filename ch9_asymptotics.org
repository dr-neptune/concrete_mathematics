* A Hierarchy

** Asymptotic Growth Ratios

$f(n) \prec g(n) \iff \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = 0$

* O Notation

** O Notation

This is used for upper bounds

$f(n) = O(g(n))$ for all n implies that there is a constant C such that $|f(n)| \leq C|g(n)|$ for all n

** $\Omega$ Notation

This is used for lower bounds

$f(n) = \Omega(g(n)) \iff |f(n)| \geq C |g(n)|$ for some $C > 0$

** $\Theta$ Notation

This is used for exact order of growth

$f(n) = \Theta(g(n)) \iff f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$ and $f(n) = O(g(n))$
