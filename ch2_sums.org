#+TITLE: Chapter 2: Sums

* Notation

Iverson introduced an interesting notation for describing a strong predicate on a value in a sum:

$\Sigma_k a_k [P(k)]$

if $[P(k)]$ is false or $a_k$ is undefined, the term $a_k [P(k)]$ is also zero, so we can safely include it among the terms being summed.

* Sums and Recurrences

* Manipulation of Sums

** Distributive Law

$\Sigma_{k \in K} c a_k = c\Sigma_{k \in K} a_k$

** Associative Law

$\Sigma_{k \in K} (a_k + b_k) = \Sigma_{k \in K} a_k + \Sigma_{k \in K} b_k$

** Commutative Law

$\Sigma_{k \in K} a_k = \Sigma_{p(k) \in K} a_{p(k)}$

Where $p(k)$ means we can partition the terms in any way we please. $p(k)$ is any permutation of the set of *all* integers

For every integer $n$, there should be exactly 1 integer $k$ such that $p(k) = n$

** Combining Different Sets of Indices

if $K$ and $K'$ are any sets of integers, then

$\Sigma_{k \in K} a_k + \Sigma_{k \in K'} a_k = \Sigma_{k \in K \cap K'} a_k + \Sigma_{k \in K \cup K'} a_k$

** Perturbation Method

The operation of splitting off a term is the basis of a *perturbation method* that often allows us to evaluate a sum in closed form

Given $S_n = \Sigma_{0 \leq k \leq n} a_k$

$S_n + a_{n + 1} = a_0 + \Sigma_{0 \leq k \leq n}a_{k + 1}$

* Multiple Sums

** Interchanging the Order of Summation

$\Sigma_j \Sigma_k a_{j, k} [P(j, k)] = \Sigma_{P(j, k)} a_{j,k} = \Sigma_k \Sigma_j a_{j, k} [P(j, k)]$

** General Distributive Law

$\Sigma_{j \in J, k \in K} a_j b_k = (\Sigma_{j \in J} a_j)(\Sigma_{k \in K} b_k)$

** Order of Summation

*** Vanilla

$\Sigma_{j \in J}\Sigma_{k \in K} a_{j, k} = \Sigma_{j \in J, k \in K} a_{j,k} = \Sigma_{k \in K}\Sigma_{j \in J} a_{j, k}$

*** Rocky Road

Applies when the range of an inner sum depends on an index variable of the outer sum
