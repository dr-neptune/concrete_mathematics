* Divisibility

** Definition: m divides n

$m\n \iff m > 0$ and $n = mk$ for some integer $k$

** Greatest Common Divisor

$\mathrm{gcd}(m,n) = \max\{k | k|m \mathrm{ and } k|n\}$

** Least Common Multiple

$\mathrm{lcm}(m, n) = \min\{k | k > 0, m | k and n | k\}$

** Euclid's Algorithm

$\gcd(0, n) = n$
$\gcd(m, n) = \gcd(n \mod m, m)$ for $m > 0$

        return 0
    if m == 0:
        return n
    else:
        new_m = n % m
        return euclids_algo(new_m, m)

We can also extend it so that it will compute integers $m', n'$ satisfying:

$m'm + n'n = \gcd(m, n)$

** Mini-theorem

$k|m$ and $k|n \iff k | \gcd(m, n)$

** Sum Rule

$\Sigma_{m | n} a_m = \Sigma_{m | n} a_{n / m}$ where $n > 0, n \in \mathcal{N}$

** More General Sum Rule

$\Sigma_{m|n} a_m = \Sigma_k \Sigma_{m > 0} a_m [n = mk]$

** Interchanging Double Sums

$\Sigma_{m | n} \Sigma_{k | m} a_{k, m} = \Sigma_{k | n} \Sigma_{l | (n / k)} a_{k, kl}$

* Primes

A positive integer $p$ is called a prime if it has just 2 divisors, namely 1 and $p$.

** Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

Any positive integer $n$ can be written as a product of primes

$n = p_1 ... p_m = \Pi_{k = 1}^m p_k$ where $p_1 \leq ... \leq p_m$

moreover, the expansion above is unique

** Another Formulation of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

Every positive integer can be written uniquely in the form:

$n = \Pi_p p^{n_p}$ where each $n^p \geq 0$


The Formula above represents $n$ uniquely, so we can think of the sequence $<n_2, n_3, n_5, ...>$ as a number system for positive integers.

For example, the prime-exponent representation of 18 is $<1,2, 0, 0, ...>$ and the prime-exponent representation of 12 is $<2, 1, 0, 0, ...>$

** Prime-Exponent Multiplication

$k = mn \iff k_p = m_p + n_p$ for all $p$

** With Division

$m|n \iff m_p \leq n_p$ for all $p$

** Min and Max Trick

$k = \gcd(m, n) \iff k_p = \min(m_p, n_p)$ for all $p$

$k = \mathrm{lcm}(m, n) \iff k_p = \max(m_p, n_p)$ for all $p$

* Prime Examples

** Euclid Numbers

$e_n = e_1 e_2 ... e_{n - 1} + 1$ when $n \geq 1$
