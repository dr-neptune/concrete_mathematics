#+TITLE: Chapter 6: Special Numbers

* Stirling Numbers

We use the notation:

Stirling numbers of the first kind:

${n \brack k}$

where we are counting the number of ways to arrange n objects into k cycles instead of subsets.
We can read this "n cycle k"

Stirling numbers of the second kind:

${n \brace k}$

which stands for the number of ways to partition a set of n things into k nonempty subsets.
We can read this as "n subset k"

** Closed Form for 2-subsets with Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind (6.2)

${n \brace 2} = 2^{n - 1} - 1$

** First Term Pull Out for Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind (6.3)

${n \brace k} = k {n - 1 \brace k} + {n - 1 \brace k - 1}$

This is how the table above was generated. Without the factor of k, it would reduce to the addition formula that generates Pascal's triangle.

* Harmonic Numbers

** Harmonic Numbers
$H_n = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + ... = \Sigma_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}$

** Recurrence between Harmonic numbers and Stirling Numbers of the First Kind

${n+1 \brack 2} = n! H_n$

** Bounds for $H_n$

$\frac{\left\lfloor \lg n \right\rfloor + 1}{2} < H_n < \left\lfloor \lg n \right\rfloor + 1$

$\ln n < H_n < \ln n + 1$

** Riemann's Zeta Function

If $r > 1$, our harmonic numbers of order $r$ approach a limit as $n \to \infty$;

$\zeta(r) = H_{\infty}^{(r)} = \Sigma_{k = 1}^n \frac{1}{k^r}$

** Euler's Constant

$\gamma = 0.5772156649$...

$\lim_{n \to \infty}(H_n - \ln n) = \gamma$

** Approximation to $H_n$

$H_n = \ln n + \gamma + \frac{1}{2n} + \frac{1}{12n^2} + \frac{\epsilon_n}{120n^4}$, $0 < \epsilon_n < 1$
