#+TITLE: Chapter 6: Special Numbers

* Stirling Numbers

We use the notation:

Stirling numbers of the first kind:

${n \brack k}$

where we are counting the number of ways to arrange n objects into k cycles instead of subsets.
We can read this "n cycle k"

Stirling numbers of the second kind:

${n \brace k}$

which stands for the number of ways to partition a set of n things into k nonempty subsets.
We can read this as "n subset k"

** Closed Form for 2-subsets with Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind (6.2)

${n \brace 2} = 2^{n - 1} - 1$

** First Term Pull Out for Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind (6.3)

${n \brace k} = k {n - 1 \brace k} + {n - 1 \brace k - 1}$

This is how the table above was generated. Without the factor of k, it would reduce to the addition formula that generates Pascal's triangle.

* Harmonic Numbers

** Harmonic Numbers
$H_n = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + ... = \Sigma_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}$

** Recurrence between Harmonic numbers and Stirling Numbers of the First Kind

${n+1 \brack 2} = n! H_n$

** Bounds for $H_n$

$\frac{\left\lfloor \lg n \right\rfloor + 1}{2} < H_n < \left\lfloor \lg n \right\rfloor + 1$

$\ln n < H_n < \ln n + 1$

** Riemann's Zeta Function

If $r > 1$, our harmonic numbers of order $r$ approach a limit as $n \to \infty$;

$\zeta(r) = H_{\infty}^{(r)} = \Sigma_{k = 1}^n \frac{1}{k^r}$

** Euler's Constant

$\gamma = 0.5772156649$...

$\lim_{n \to \infty}(H_n - \ln n) = \gamma$

** Approximation to $H_n$

$H_n = \ln n + \gamma + \frac{1}{2n} + \frac{1}{12n^2} + \frac{\epsilon_n}{120n^4}$, $0 < \epsilon_n < 1$

* Harmonic Summation

** Binomial Harmonic Sum

$\Sigma_{0 \leq k < n} {k \choose m} H_k = {n \choose m + 1}{H_n - \frac{1}{m + 1}}$

* Bernoulli Numbers

** Formulation

$S_m(n) = 0^m + 1^m + ... + (n - 1)^m = \Sigma_{k = 0}^{n - 1} k^m = \Sigma_0^n x^m \delta x$

** Definition by Implicit Recurrence Relation

$\Sigma_{j=0}^m {m+1 \choose j} B_j = [m=0]$ for all $m \geq 0$

** Bernoulli Numbers are coefficients of the Power Series

$\frac{z}{e^z - 1} = \Sigma_{n \geq 0}B_n \frac{z^n}{n!}$

** Relationship Between Bernoulli Numbers and Stirling Numbers

$\Sigma_k {n \brace k}{k \brack m} \frac{(-1)^{k - m}}{k} = \frac{1}{n} {n \choose m} B_{n - m} + [m = n - 1]$

* Fibonacci Numbers

** Recurrence Definition

$F_0 = 0$
$F_1 = 1$
$F_n = F_{n - 1} + F_{n - 2}$

** Cassini's Identity

$F_{n + 1} F_{n - 1} - F_n^2 = (-1)^n$

** Fibonacci Numbers Extension to Negative Number Line

$F_{-n} = (-1)^{n - 1}F_n$

** Zeckendorf's Theorem

Let $j >> k \iff j \geq k + 2$

Then every positive integer has a unique representation of the form

$n = F_{k_1} + F_{k_2} + ... + F_{k_r}$ where $k_1 >> k_2 >> ... >> k_r >> 0$

** Fibonacci Number System

Any unique system of representation is a number system; therefore Zeckendorf's theorem leads to the *Fibonacci Number System*.
We can represent any nonnegative integer n as a sequence of 0's and 1's, writing

$n = (b_m b_{m - 1} ... b_2)_F \iff n = \Sigma_{k = 2}^m b_k F_k$

This number system is something like binary (radix 2) notation, except that there are never 2 adjacent 1's.

** Closed Form for Fibonacci Numbers

$F(z) = \frac{z}{1 - z - z^2}$

** Binet's (Euler's) Formula

$F_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt5}(\frac{1}{1 - \Phi z} - \frac{1}{1 - \hat{\Phi}z})$

** Another Closed Form

$F_n = \left\lfloor \frac{\Phi^n}{\sqrt 5} + \frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor = \frac{\Phi^n}{\sqrt 5}$ rounded to the nearest integer

* Continuants

** Continuant Polynomial

$K_0() = 1$
$K_1(x_1) = x_1$
$K_n(x_1, ..., x_n) = K_{n - 1}(x_1, ..., x_{n - 1})x_n + K_{n - 2}(x_1, ..., x_{n - 2})$

** Continuant Relation to Continued Fractions

let $[a_0, ..., a_n]$ represent the continued fraction with $n$ terms.

Then $[a_0, ..., a_n] = \frac{K(a_0, a_1, ..., a_n)}{K(a_1, ..., a_n)}$
