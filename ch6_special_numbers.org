#+TITLE: Chapter 6: Special Numbers

* Stirling Numbers

We use the notation:

Stirling numbers of the first kind:

${n \brack k}$

where we are counting the number of ways to arrange n objects into k cycles instead of subsets.
We can read this "n cycle k"

Stirling numbers of the second kind:

${n \brace k}$

which stands for the number of ways to partition a set of n things into k nonempty subsets.
We can read this as "n subset k"

** Closed Form for 2-subsets with Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind (6.2)

${n \brace 2} = 2^{n - 1} - 1$

** First Term Pull Out for Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind (6.3)

${n \brace k} = k {n - 1 \brace k} + {n - 1 \brace k - 1}$

This is how the table above was generated. Without the factor of k, it would reduce to the addition formula that generates Pascal's triangle.
